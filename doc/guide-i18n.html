    <strong>I18n In 8 Minutes</strong>
    
</div>

<p>This page describes how to completely internationalize and localize a Chicago Boss app in just a few minutes.</p>
<p><em>Introduction.</em> I18n is something most people avoid, and for good reason: to get even basic i18n, you've traditionally needed to to hire translators, rewrite large amounts of the code base, and muck around with PO- and MO-files. But Chicago Boss makes I18n nice and simple. If you don't mind quick-and-dirty translations from Google Translate for a first pass, you won't even need translators.</p>
<p><em>Step 1</em>: The first and hardest step is to <em>internationalize</em> your templates by putting strings you want to translate into a special <code>trans</code> tag, e.g.:</p>
<div class="code">
    <span class="braces">{%</span> <span class="keyword">trans</span> <span class="string">"Welcome!"</span> <span class="braces">%}</span>
</div>
<p>If you have code that displays validation errors returned from <a href="api-record.html#save">BossRecord:save()</a>, you should put those in <code>trans</code> tags, too, e.g.:</p>
<div class="code">
    <span class="bracket">&lt;<span class="name">ol</span>&gt;</span><br />
    <span class="braces">{%</span> <span class="keyword">for</span> error <span class="keyword">in</span> validation_errors <span class="braces">%}</span><br />
    <span class="bracket">&lt;<span class="name">li</span>&gt;</span><span class="braces">{%</span> <span class="keyword">trans</span> error <span class="braces">%}</span><br />
    <span class="braces">{%</span> <span class="keyword">endfor</span> <span class="braces">%}</span><br />
    <span class="bracket">&lt;/<span class="name">ol</span>&gt;</span>
</div>
<p><em>Step 2</em>: Now we need to create a language file. Visit /admin/lang on your development server. You should see a page like this:</p>
<img src="http://www.chicagoboss.org/images/translator-new.jpg" />
<p><em>Step 3</em>: Click "New language file"</p>
<img src="http://www.chicagoboss.org/images/translator-create.jpg" />
<p><em>Step 4</em>: Choose a language for which you want to have a translation, and click "Create language file".</p>
<p><em>Step 5</em>: You should a page with a lot of messages pulled from your app's templates, as well as all the error messages returned by the <code>validation_errors()</code> function of your data models. (You'll see messages taken from the /admin interface itself, too.)</p>
<img src="http://www.chicagoboss.org/images/translator-untrans.jpg" />
<p><em>Step 6</em>: Fill out the form yourself, or cheat and click "Fill in the blanks with Google!"</p>
<img src="http://www.chicagoboss.org/images/translator-untrans-filled.jpg" />
<p><em>Step 7</em>: Click "Submit translations"</p>
<p><em>Step 8</em>: You should see all of your translations for the language you chose.</p>
<img src="http://www.chicagoboss.org/images/translator-trans.jpg" />
<p>...and that's it! Visitors to your site who specify this language in their browsers will automatically see these messages instead of the original ones.</p>
<p>You can find the files used for translations in the <code>Lang/</code> directory in your project directory. They're just PO-files, so if your PO-foo is strong you can edit them directly.</p>
<p>What if you want to override the language specified in a user's browser settings? Not a problem. You just need to return a "Content-Language" HTTP header from your controller, like so:</p>
<div class="code">
    {ok, [], [{<span class="string">"Content-Language"</span>, <span class="string">"fr"</span>}]}.
</div>
<p>That code would ensure that the French language strings are used (assuming you created a language file for <code>fr</code>).</p>

<br />
<br />
<h3>Technical Appendix: How Boss Chooses Which Language To Serve</h3>
<p>Most web browsers send an "Accept-Language" HTTP header which specifies the user's language preferences. This header will look something like:</p>
<div class="code">
    Accept-Language: en, fr;q=0.9, de;q=0.8
</div>
<p>That is, each language has "q-value" which specifies the strength of the preference. If a q-value is not specified, then it is assumed to be 1.0. Here, English gets a q-value of 1.0, French of 0.9, and German of 0.8.</p>
<p>Q-values are <em>not</em> simply relative preferences; that is, changing the German q-value from 0.8 down to 0.6 could change which language gets served up, even though the order of preferred languages is completely unchanged. HTTP specifies that the "quality" of each translation be multiplied by the client's corresponding q-value, then the language with the highest resulting value be chosen. That is,</p>
<div class="code">
    LanguageScore = ClientQValue * TranslationQuality
</div>
<p>How does Boss define translation quality for a language? Simple: it just uses the <em>fraction of translatable strings in a given template that have been translated for that language</em>.</p>
<p>Quick example: say a template has 3 translatable strings (in English), and the client q-values are 1.0 for French and 0.5 for English. The language score for English is </p>
<div class="code">
    EnglishScore = 0.5 * (3 / 3) = 0.5
</div>
<p>If two of the three strings are available in French, then
<div class="code">
    FrenchScore = 1.0 * (2 / 3) = 0.67
</div>
<p>And French will be served, because 0.67 is greater than 0.5. But if only one of the three strings is available in French, then</p>
<div class="code">
    FrenchScore = 1.0 * (1 / 3) = 0.33
</div>
<p>And English will be served, because 0.33 is less than 0.5.</p>

<p>One side effect is that if strings in some templates have more translations than other templates, users could see different languages as they navigate the site. Sounds weird, but of course we're always delivering the best translation to the user that we can. The best thing to do is to translate all your strings, or else override the inferred language by setting the "Content-Language" header based on a user preference.</p>
