# ChicagoBoss Changelog

(Note: Prior to Version 0.8.8, changelog is contained in commit history)

### Version 0.9.0 (in development)
* Fixed bug with version in the .app file generation (@davidw)

### Version 0.8.13 - Mostly SQL Stuff... Mostly.

* Update BossDB to support `boss_db:find_by_sql/[2,3]`, allowing direct SQL
  searches to be performed if desired. Attempting this call with non-SQL based
  databases will crash. (@davidw for PostgreSQL, @choptastic for MySQL).
* Split boss_test into its own application and added as a dependency for
  boss_db.
* MySQL Test suite for BossDB now passing all tests.
* BossDB Test configuration slightly updated.
* Added `boss_db:mock_transaction/1`, which, like an actual transaction will
  lock all requests to a certain worker, without being an actual transaction.
  (used in boss_db tests).
* Fix link in rebar.config to Elixir for Erlang 17.
* Give a more useful error message when `{render_other, Location}` controller
  return is not properly formatted.
* Added sample configurations for MongoDB as well as a minimistic version of
  the boss.config. These can be found in `sample_configs/` in the main
  ChicagoBoss directory (@kotedo)
* Update Makefile to use the proper destination directory instead of just
  `../project_name` (@ingwinlu)

*(All updates by @choptastic unless specified)*

### Version 0.8.12 - Stability improvements

* Add option to make local relative redirects (@danikp)
* Fix translations with the use of 'Content-Type' headers.
* Fix update ErlyDTL to a version 0.9.4, which fixes a number of stability and
  compatibility issues.  **Update to rebar executable required for this**
* Make updates to allow compilation with Erlang 17.0
* A generated ChicagoBoss app will now default to searching "./priv" in the
  event that the directory name is different from the app name.
* Update boss_db to using 'epgsql/epgsql' (@davidw)
* Add some extra error handling where silent errors were occurring so they can
  be debugged.
* Fix routing so that matched values can appear in the action as well as the
  extra parameters.
* Some refactoring of the boss_router_controller.
* Fix Erlang node full-name and short-name incompatibilities (@davidw)
* Ensure all tests pass, removed some tests for code that was removed.
* Fix generated app issue where the 'boss' application was being loaded from
  the original location rather than from the 'deps/boss' directory as expected.
* Modify module compile-time comparison to remove unnecessary conversions to
  gregorian time.
* boss_db handle 'undefined' as a value with select queries. (@davidw)
* Consolodate ebin finding and remove duplicates (@davidw)
* Clean up inconsistent dependency versions so that `rebar update-deps` works.

*(All updates by @choptastic unless specified)*
